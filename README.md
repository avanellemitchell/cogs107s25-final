This is my final project submission for Cogs 107! For this assignment, I used Python to analyze a dataset of simulated reaction time (RT) data collected from a 2x2x2 experimental design. The variables in the experiment were trial difficulty (Easy vs Hard), stimulus type (Simple vs Complex), and signal presence. The goal was to analyze participant performance using Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and delta plots, and to compare how each of the two main manipulations, stimulus type and trial difficulty, impacted behavior.

I used the original functions provided in sdt_ddm.py to load the data, build an SDT model, and create delta plots. I added my own code to actually run the SDT analysis (run_sdt_analysis.py) and delta plot analysis (run_delta_plots_individually.py and run_delta_plots_population.py). I also wrote a script to compute average reaction time percentiles across all participants so that I could generate population-wide delta plots. That code is saved in mean_rt_percentiles.py, and the final population-level delta plots are saved as population_delta_plots.png.

The model outputs include posterior distributions for sensitivity (d′) and bias (criterion), and I verified convergence of the SDT model using Arviz summary diagnostics. I also visualized the results using bar plots with error bars to help interpret differences between conditions. Finally to summarize the combined insights, I wrote a short markdown file called combined_sdt_delta_insights.md where I explain what I found. In it I compare the SDT results and the delta plot results, and give an interpretation of what each manipulation (difficulty and stimulus type) seemed to affect.

All the code files and output plots are stored in the final folder. You can run any of the code to reproduce my results or get a closer look at the analysis. I’ve done my best to follow the assignment instructions closely and make sure everything is clearly organized and labeled. I also used generative AI to help me throughout this assignment. Let me know if you need anything else!
